According to the **[official website](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2)**, 
`mysql2` is a MySQL client for Node.js with focus on performance.  

Drizzle ORM natively supports `mysql2` with `drizzle-orm/mysql2` package.

There're two ways you can connect to the MySQL with `mysql2` driver, either single `client` connection or a `pool`.

  ```typescript copy filename="index.ts"
  import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";
  import mysql from "mysql2/promise";

  const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
    host: "host",
    user: "user",
    database: "database",
    ...
  });

  const db = drizzle(connection);
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  ```typescript copy filename="index.ts"
  import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";
  import mysql from "mysql2/promise";

  const poolConnection = mysql.createPool({
    host: "host",
    user: "user",
    database: "database",
    ...
  });

  const db = drizzle(poolConnection);
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚙️">
  For the built in `migrate` function with DDL migrations we and drivers strongly encourage you to use single `client` connection.  

  For querying purposes feel free to use either `client` or `pool` based on your business demands.
