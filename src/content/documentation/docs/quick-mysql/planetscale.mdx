According to the **[official website](https://planetscale.com/)**, 
PlanetScale is the world's most advanced serverless MySQL platform.

With Drizzle ORM you can access PlanetScale over http
through their official **[`database-js`](https://github.com/planetscale/database-js)**
driver from serverless and serverfull environments with our `drizzle-orm/planetscale-serverless` package.

You can also access PlanetScale through TCP with `mysql2` driver â€” **[see here.](/docs/quick-mysql/mysql2)**

<Npm>
drizzle-orm @planetscale/database
-D drizzle-kit
</Npm>

```typescript copy filename="index.ts"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/planetscale-serverless";
import { connect } from "@planetscale/database";

// create the connection
const connection = connect({
  host: process.env["DATABASE_HOST"],
  username: process.env["DATABASE_USERNAME"],
  password: process.env["DATABASE_PASSWORD"],
});

const db = drizzle(connection);
```
